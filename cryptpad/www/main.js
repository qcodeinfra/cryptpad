/*  CryptPad's example NGINX config includes a list of pages
    which should have their URLs rewritten to include a trailing slash.
    Sometimes we create a new page and forget to add it to these list.
    Sometimes people configure their instance without this rewrite rule.

    In either case, they might enter a URL like `/checkup` (without the
    trailing slash) and somehow end up trying to load this script. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    This script helps to avoid reports of confusion due to blank pages
    like in some of the comments here: (https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/246)
    by using jquery to check if adding a trailing slash would help,
    and redirecting automatically if so.
